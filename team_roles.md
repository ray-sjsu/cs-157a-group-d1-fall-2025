# Team roles and collaboration
## Overview
CS-157A Personal Database Application is a semester-long project with teams of four group members. The topic of choice is a Music Application database.

The project is broken down into 3 phases: A, B, C. Phase C is the culmination of the work done in Phase A and B.

Team members: Jonathan, Raymund, Christopher, Daeren

## Collaboration
In Phase C, SQL code were reused from Phase A and B. This is a summary of the work contributed throughout the project.

### Phase A
- Jonathan proposed the initial project idea of a Music Application database.
- Daeren and Jonathan worked together on the entity-relationship, and relational schema diagrams.
- Christopher setup team collaboration in LucidChart to create diagrams. Finalized the diagrams.
- Raymund revised and reviewed the diagrams. Created and formatted powerpoint presentation.

### Phase B
- Christopher and Daeren worked on SQL statements in `.sql` files (Population, Creation, Indexes, `SELECT`, `TRIGGERS`).
- Jonathan worked on SQL code review/testing and Funtional Dependencies.
- Raymund was responsible for organization, submission, and video demo.

### Phase C
- Work done in **Phase A and B** was transferred into `create_and_populate.sql`.
- Christopher worked on `view.sql` for creating views.
- Jonathan worked on `routine.sql` for creating routines.
- Daeren worked on `transactions` in `Main.java` and `PreparedStatements`.
- Raymund wrote Java code with Java JBDC, UI/UX menus, and error handling. Troubleshooted SQL code execution. Recorded video demo.

## Reflection
For a semester wide project and considering contributions in all three phases, each team member contributed fairly and finished their assigned tasks.

In terms of team roles (seniority):
- Christopher was team leader and lead presenter (Phase A).
- Raymund was the project manager and organizer with focus on presentation and deliverable quality.

In terms of code and programming:
- Christopher, Jonathan, and Daeren wrote mostly SQL.
- Raymund wrote mostly Java, and some SQL.
